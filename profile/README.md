Wraft is an open-source content authoring platform that's helps businesses produce their most important set of documents. Wraft helps author structured business content. From official letters to contracts, and beyond.

Our goal is to give people complete control over their most important documents, from drafting to collaborating and distributing.

Wraft is built on top of open formats, using markdown and JSON. This means your content is always accessible and future-proof.

### Architecture

Wraft has a split tech architecture where the frontend is in React and the backend is in Elixir.
